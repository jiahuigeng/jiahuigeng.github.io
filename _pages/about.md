I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working with [Prof. Fakhri Karray](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/fakhri-karray/), [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/staff_ukp/detailseite_mitarbeiter_1_42560.en.jsp), and [Prof. Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/). I received my Ph.D. from the University of Stavanger under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie project [CLARIFY](https://www.uis.no/nb/forskning/clarify), my M.Sc. from RWTH Aachen University, and my B.Eng. from Southeast University. I will soon be joining [Linköping University](https://liu.se/) in Sweden as a tenure-track Assistant Professor.

My research interests center on the **safety, trustworthiness, and alignment of large language models**, as well as **agentic AI**, **information retrieval**, and **code generation**. I aim to build reliable and transparent AI systems that can reason, act, and collaborate safely with humans. I have published papers at top-tier venues including NeurIPS, ICCV, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, AAAI, and IJCAI, and I currently serve as an Area Chair for ACL ARR.

I am always open to academic discussions and collaborations—feel free to reach out if you share similar interests!
